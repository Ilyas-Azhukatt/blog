i am thinking about learning python because it is widely used for data analysis,machine learning etc.   
    *   ruby mainly focuses on webdevelopment with ruby on rails  
    *   read comparison between django and rails   
    *   django has great community   
    *   rails has static generator like jekyll

    
>>  *read about jekyll and saw some sites created with jekyll
    *read about similar software s for python pelican,hyde etc
    *read about micro framework flask
    *it is a lightweight python web development framework
    *some people are saying it is better for beginners to start with flask instead of django because it is simple.
>>  *read how to make a simple blog using flask
>>  *read how to make a simple blog using django
    *i plan to study django because it seems both needs some learning,so it is better to learn a high level framework.
>>  *I have a wish to learn jekyll, so that I think you have to learn some ruby.
